# Sovereign Chess

This project is a digital app version of a chess variation "Sovereign Chess" by Mark Bates. This project is a hobby project, expect there to be bugs and messy undocumented code.

This project is by no means official, and this variation is not mine. Have a look at https://www.infinitepigames.com/sovereign-chess.
